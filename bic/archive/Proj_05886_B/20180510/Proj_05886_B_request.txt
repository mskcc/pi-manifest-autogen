ProjectDesc: The aim of this project is to identify a molecular signature in a cancer gene in SNUCcould help in better characterization of this entity and serve as an objective moleculardiagnostic marker and/or a potential molecular therapeutic target which could be used as anadjunct and/or as the alternative to the current (very aggressive) management of SNUCpatients.
